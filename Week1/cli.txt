1.How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

	"touch .fileName" command creates a hidden file.
	"touch .folderName" command created a hidden folder.
	"ls -a" displays all files and directories including hidden files and directories.

2.How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

	"mkdir -p /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun" will create the nested directories.

3.How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
	
	firstname
	lastname

	"echo 'text' >> fileName" will append the text end of the file.
